# Danger Engine 
- Written by MyGoodSir (Joseph Danger Adrian)

Description
- This version uses deffered rendering to deal with a large quantity of expensive lighting calculations, however that will change in the future as my goal for this project is not to create an efficient (if you can even call this implementation efficient) renderer.

Notes
- Many assets come from various opengl tutorials, I'll create a list here soon, but this project is meant for personal use anyway.
- assimp wanted to be compiled with MSVC so I ditched my beloved build system and now im just using Visual Studio 2019 :(
